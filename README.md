# Annette
Annette is a semi-automatic annotation application that is used from a Web browser. It has been created during an intership done in the EnCoV research team at Institut Pascal in Clermont-Ferrand (France).

Needs inference masks for the "automatic" part. I also created an inference making application in Python that can be used in addition with Annette.
